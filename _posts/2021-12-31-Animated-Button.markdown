This is the main page i made for the new component i developed in the last week in class, is just a button with a pulse animation and random color change.

There also are methods that allow you o change de duration of the animation and the size of the component to specify the range of animation

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
